# SOSA

There are two SOSA projects here. The one that we will probably work on is "New Sosa". The one that is original (from last year) is "Old Sosa". The new one has its libraries in a lib folder instead of seperate packages. And the only discrepencie that I see is the text for a stimuli once you start the experiment.

You will need to configure the correct library for your system.
In eclipse, once you have imported Sosa. Make sure the project is highlighted. Go to project in the, select properties, java build path, Libraries tab, "swt.jar", edit, and make sure the one for your system is selected. Should be straight forward from there. That should get it running.

You must also have excel on your computer for it to output the correct files when the project is finished.
